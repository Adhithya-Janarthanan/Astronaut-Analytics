# Astronaut Analytics: A Data Science Exploration of NASA Astronaut Profiles

## Project Summary  
This project presents an in-depth analysis of NASA astronaut profiles from 1959 to 2009. It explores how factors such as gender, alma mater, military background, and mission experience shape the composition and selection of astronauts. Originally completed in R, this project has been fully re-implemented in Python using `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `matplotlib` to provide a modern, reproducible analysis pipeline.

Through visualizations and data-driven exploration, the project uncovers key trends in the astronaut corps, offering insights into the demographics of spaceflight over five decades.

## Objectives
- Understand demographic trends in astronaut selection  
- Identify the most represented academic institutions and military ranks  
- Analyze gender and spaceflight distributions  
- Reproduce original R-based insights in a Python environment
